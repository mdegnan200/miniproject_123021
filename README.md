Python Project Requirement:  
  Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. 
  (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

Remember the rules:
    ●	Rock beats scissors
    ●	Scissors beats paper
    ●	Paper beats rock

Notes: 
  Player is instructed to enter: 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissor'.  If he/she/they is done with the game, player is instructed to enter: 'quit'.  
  Message is printed to note the winner. 
  Allowance is made for upper/lower case entry.  For instance, Paper will be understood the same as PAPER.
